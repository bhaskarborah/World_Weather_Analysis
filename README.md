# Module 6 Challenge - World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

PlanMyTrip is an online travel provider and enabler company. They help travelers or customers find their ideal place to visit and ideal places/hotels to stay based on the customer's preferences. They want to find out the best time to visit a particular place and the ideal hotel to stay in that place based on the choices of the customer such as the minimum and maximum preferred temperature. 

## Purpose

In order to find out the ideal choices for a customer, the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
Below are the expected deliverables for this project:

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
